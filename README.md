# Volume mixer and audio controller (first pcb design) #


## Goals: ##
* Create a pcb
* Music controls
  * Song skip
  * Song play
  * Song pause
* Volume control - though rotary encoder

## Design: ##

Its basically an Arduino Pro Micro just put in the form factor that I wanted. It features 4 MX style contacts for your switches to sit on. There is also a pinout for a rotary encoder for volume adjustment. In the final design I plan to just solder wires to the rotary encoder since the knob I want wont be able to sit right next to the switches. I will make a branch with the code that I eventually use, as well as another branch for the .stl I eventually create, but for now I'm just making sure the circut board actually works.
